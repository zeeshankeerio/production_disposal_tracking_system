The timezone functionality has been successfully implemented and tested. Here are the current test results:

### **Timestamp Generation Test Results:**
- **Current UTC time:** 2025-06-19T23:35:23.865Z
- **Current Eastern time:** 6/19/2025, 7:35:23 PM
- **Formatted display:** June 19, 2025 at 07:35:23 PM

### **Timezone Scenarios Tested:**
1. **Winter (EST):** January 15, 2024 at 05:30:00 AM
2. **Summer (EDT):** July 15, 2024 at 06:30:00 AM
3. **DST Spring Forward:** March 10, 2024 at 01:30:00 AM
4. **DST Fall Back:** November 3, 2024 at 01:30:00 AM

## üöÄ **How to Test the Application**

### **Step 1: Access the Application**
- Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3001**
- The development server is running and ready for testing

### **Step 2: Test Production Entries**
1. Navigate to **/production** in the application
2. Fill out the production form:
   - Select a product
   - Enter quantity
   - Choose shift (Morning/Afternoon/Night)
   - Set production date
   - Set expiration date
   - Add staff name
3. **Submit the form**
4. **Verify the created_at timestamp:**
   - The entry should appear in the list
   - Click on the entry to expand details
   - Check that "Created at" shows current US Eastern time

### **Step 3: Test Disposal Entries**
1. Navigate to **/disposal** in the application
2. Fill out the disposal form:
   - Select a product
   - Enter quantity
   - Choose shift
   - Set disposal date
   - Select reason
   - Add staff name
3. **Submit the form**
4. **Verify the created_at timestamp:**
   - The entry should appear in the list
   - Click on the entry to expand details
   - Check that "Created at" shows current US Eastern time

### **Step 4: Test Dashboard View**
1. Go to the **Dashboard** (home page)
2. Check the "Recent Entries" section
3. Verify that all timestamps display in US Eastern time
4. Click on entries to see detailed timestamps

### **Step 5: Test Entry Details**
1. From any entry list, click on an entry to expand it
2. Look for the "Created at" field in the expanded details
3. Verify the timestamp format: "Month Day, Year at HH:MM:SS AM/PM"
4. Confirm the time matches current US Eastern time

## üîç **What to Look For**

### **‚úÖ Correct Behavior:**
- All created_at timestamps show current US Eastern time
- Timestamps format as: "June 19, 2025 at 07:35:23 PM"
- Entry dates display in US Eastern timezone
- No timezone conversion errors
- Consistent timezone handling across all pages

### **‚ùå Issues to Report:**
- Timestamps showing wrong timezone
- Timestamps showing UTC time instead of Eastern
- Inconsistent timezone display across different pages
- Date parsing errors
- Missing or invalid timestamps

## üìä **Expected Test Results**

### **Current Time Test:**
- **System UTC:** 2025-06-19T23:35:23.865Z
- **Expected Eastern:** 6/19/2025, 7:35:23 PM
- **Expected Display:** June 19, 2025 at 07:35:23 PM

### **Database Storage:**
- Timestamps stored as: "6/19/2025, 7:35:23 PM"
- Retrieved and formatted correctly
- No timezone conversion issues

## üõ† **Technical Implementation**

### **Key Functions Used:**
- `createEasternTimestamp()` - Generates timestamps in US Eastern time
- `formatDate()` - Formats dates for display
- `parseDateFromDatabase()` - Parses dates from database
- `toLocalTime()` - Converts dates to local timezone

### **Database Compatibility:**
- Uses existing TEXT fields (no migration needed)
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Proper timezone handling for storage and retrieval

## üéØ **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Development server running on http://localhost:3001
- [ ] Can create production entries
- [ ] Can create disposal entries
- [ ] Created_at timestamps show current US Eastern time
- [ ] Entry details display correct timestamps
- [ ] Dashboard shows recent entries with correct timestamps
- [ ] No timezone conversion errors
- [ ] All dates display consistently in US Eastern time

## üìù **Reporting Issues**

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Note the exact timestamp displayed**
2. **Compare with expected US Eastern time**
3. **Check browser console for errors**
4. **Report the specific page and action that caused the issue**

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

The implementation is successful when:
- All created_at timestamps display current US Eastern time
- No timezone conversion errors occur
- Consistent timezone handling across all features
- Database storage and retrieval work correctly
- User experience is smooth and intuitive
